.. py:function:: process_exp_data(experimental_data_path: str) -> str

   Check formatting and units in input experimental data file.

   If values for q are in Ã…ngstrom, they are converted to nanometer.
   Any q-values above 5nm^(-1) are removed, as SAXS calculations are not reliable in that
   range.

   :param experimental_data_path: Path to experimental SAXS data file.
   :type experimental_data_path: :py:class:`str`

   :returns:     Path to experimental SAXS data file with any applied changes.
   :rtype: str

.. py:function:: correct_exp_error(experimental_data_path: str) -> str

   Correct experimental error of input experimental data file using BIFT.

   Bayesian Indirect Fourier Transformation (BIFT) can identify whether the
   experimental error in small-angle scattering data is over- or
   underestimated. The error values are then scaled accordingly.

   :param experimental_data_path: Path to experimental SAXS data file.
   :type experimental_data_path: :py:class:`str`
