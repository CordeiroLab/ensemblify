.. py:function:: ensemblify_pipeline(parameters: str, analysis: bool = True, exp_data: str | None = None)

   Function that uses all the functionalities of the ensemblify Python library.

   Consists of 4 main steps:

   - Ensemble Generation using ensemblify.generation.generate_ensemble

   - Trajectory Creation using ensemblify.conversion.ensemble2traj

   - Trajectory Analysis using ensemblify.analysis.analyze_trajectory

   - Ensemble Reweighting using ensemblify.reweighting.reweight_ensemble

   :param parameters: Path to a parameters .yaml file (generated by .html form or manually setup by user).
   :type parameters: :py:class:`str`
   :param analysis: Whether to perform the analysis of the ensemble. Defaults to True.
   :type analysis: :py:class:`bool`
   :param exp_data: Path to a .dat file with experimental (SAXS) data of the protein being ensemblified.
                    If given, reweighting of the generated ensemble will be performed based on this data.
                    Defaults to None.
