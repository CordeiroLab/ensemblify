Modifications:
--------------
The mdreader_CHANGED.py file is a modified version of the original source code file
./mdreader-master/mdreader.py, and contains a modified version of the original MDReader class,
SimpleMDReader. The main changes made consisted in removing functionalities that were not used
through Ensemblify, updating compatibility with recent versions of numpy, removing support for
Python versions <=2.7 and documenting and styling the code to be consistent with the rest of 
Ensemblify's source code. The functionality of the code remained essentially the same, so any
novel or interesting code implementations spotted can be fully attributed to MDReader's original
creator, Manuel M. Melo.
