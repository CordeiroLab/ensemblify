The mdreader_CHANGED.py file is a modified version of the original source code file mdreader.py:

    - In lines 694+695:
        if self.opts.verbose and self.p_id == 0:
            sys.stderr.write("Loading...\n")
      was changed to:
        # if self.opts.verbose and self.p_id == 0:
        #     sys.stderr.write("Loading...\n")

    - In lines 718+719:
            if not self.opts.asframenum and not self.p_id:
                sys.stderr.write("Trajectory has no time information. Will interpret limits as frame numbers.\n")
      was changed to:
            # if not self.opts.asframenum and not self.p_id:
            #     sys.stderr.write("Trajectory has no time information. Will interpret limits as frame numbers.\n")

    - In line 793:
        sys.stderr.write("Iterating through trajectory...\n")
      was changed to:
        #sys.stderr.write("Iterating through trajectory...\n")

    - In line 1176:
                frames_per_worker = np.ones(self.p_num,dtype=np.int)*((self.totalframes-self.p_overlap)//self.p_num)
      was changed to:
                frames_per_worker = np.ones(self.p_num,dtype=int)*((self.totalframes-self.p_overlap)//self.p_num)

These were all minimal changes to make the code compatible with Ensemblify's use case, and other than printing less
messages to the console they do not alter the functionality of mdreader in any way.

All other files taken from the original distribution were not modified in any way.
