Modifications:
--------------
In the BME.py file line number 13 was altered from:
    import BME_tools as bt
to:
    import ensemblify_TEST.reweighting.third_party.BME_main.BME_tools as bt

This was done simply to make the absolute import of BME_tools auxiliary functions
possible and does not alter the functionality of BME in any way.

All other files taken from the original distribution were not modified in any way.
