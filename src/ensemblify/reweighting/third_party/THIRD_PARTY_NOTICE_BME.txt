Modifications:
--------------
The simple_BME.py and simple_BME_tools.py files are a modified version of the original source code
files ./BME_main/BME.py and ./BME_main/BME_tools.py, and contain a modified version of the original
Reweight class, SimpleReweight and its auxiliary functions. The main changes made consisted in
removing functionalities that were not used through Ensemblify and documenting and styling the code
to be consistent with the rest of Ensemblify's source code. The functionality of the code remained
essentially the same, so any novel or interesting code implementations spotted can be fully
attributed to BME's original authors.
